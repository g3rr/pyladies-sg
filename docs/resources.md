#Resources for PyLadies Singapore

Here you will find all tutorials and slides from our past workshops.

##1. Python Introduction

Our first workshop shows you how to install Python, and essential tools like
virtualenv, virtualenv wrapper, and [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) as your editor.

There isn't much Python programming involved, but it gives you the tools to
start your journey!

##2. mkdocs Introduction

Our second workshop was about creating a website with
[mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org), and host it for free on
[GitHub](https://github.com).

By the way, this very website has been created during the workshop. And you can
find the code on
[github.com/pythonsingapore/pyladies-sg](https://github.com/pythonsingapore/pyladies-sg)
